							<strong>Baggage Damage</strong>
						</p>
						<p className="mb-4">

							<strong>24 hours</strong> of your transportation service at{" "}
							<strong>elitetransportationpc.com</strong>.
						</p>
						<p className="mb-4">
							Please note that some signs of wear and tear are normal due to
							regular handling during travel. Even high-quality luggage can show
							signs of wear after multiple trips, as its durability is affected
							over time. Poorly constructed luggage may have a short lifespan
							when subjected to the handling and stacking processes involved in
							air and ground transportation. Baggage is typically stacked in the
							cargo area of the vehicle, and we recommend that{" "}
							<strong>fragile items</strong> not be placed in the baggage area.
						</p>
						<p className="mb-4">
							We <strong>will not</strong> be liable for:
						</p>
						<ul className="list-ticks list-ticks-small">
							<li>
								<strong>Ordinary wear and tear</strong>
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Inherent defects</strong> in the baggage
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Poor quality</strong> or construction of the baggage
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Over-packing</strong> or exceeding baggage capacity
							</li>
						</ul>

						<p className="mb-4">
							<strong>Vehicle Capacity</strong>
						</p>
						<p className="mb-4">
							For our <strong>SUV service</strong>, the maximum recommended
							capacity is 4<strong> passengers</strong> with luggage.
						</p>
						<p className="mb-4">
							Please note that{" "}
							<strong>
								passenger capacity is dependent on the amount of luggage
							</strong>{" "}
							each person brings. Excessive luggage can quickly reduce the
							seating capacity of the vehicle, so we encourage you to plan
							accordingly.
						</p>

						<p className="mb-4">
							<strong>Baggage Allowance</strong>
						</p>
						<p className="mb-4">
							On average, each passenger is allowed{" "}
							<strong>one large bag</strong> and{" "}
							<strong>one medium-sized bag</strong>. If you have an excessive
							amount of luggage, skis, snowboards, strollers, or similar items
							that reduce the number of available seats needed to lawfully
							secure all passengers, a <strong>second vehicle</strong> may be
							required. Additional vehicles will be subject to{" "}
							<strong>availability</strong> and must be reserved in advance.
